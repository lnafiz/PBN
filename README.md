### Project Description
Our project is an implementation of Blackjack that is playable within the Terminal. We have tried our best to follow the traditional rules of Blackjack as played in casinos, although with much lower stakes. Instead of betting real money, players will have a score that changes over individual games. To simulate a more real-life experience, we allow games to have multiple participants or bots that play alongside the user. 

### How-to-Launch
- Clone the repo and open it on your local machine via its terminal.
- Compile and run Woo.java by entering the commands ```javac Woo.java``` followed by ```java Woo```.
- You will be prompted to input a number from 0-7 depending on the # of bots you want to play against. 
- After that, the game will start and you will be given a list of possible actions you can do as well as a corresponding number to the left of it. Input the number that is next to your desired action and you are all set to play.
