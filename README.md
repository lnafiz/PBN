### Project Description
Our project is an implementation of Blackjack that is playable within the Terminal. We have tried our best to follow the traditional rules of Blackjack as played in casinos, although with much lower stakes. Players will start with 10 credits, which act as tokens for playing multiple games. Each game played will spend 1 credit. If you win, you get 2 credits, 1 to make up for the one spent, and an extra as a reward. If you lose, then you get nothing. When you reach 0 credits, your playing session will end. To play again, you will have to run the program again. To simulate a more real-life experience, we allow games to have multiple participants or bots that play alongside the user. 

### How-to-Launch
- Clone the repo and open it on your local machine via its terminal.
- Compile and run Woo.java by entering the commands ```javac Woo.java``` followed by ```java Woo```.
- You will be prompted to input a number from 0-7 depending on the # of bots you want to play against (0 means you only play with Dealer, it's a separate entity from Bot). 
- After that, the game will start and you will be given a list of possible actions you can do as well as a corresponding number to the left of it. Input the number that is next to your desired action and you are all set to play.
